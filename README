This is a "plugin" for the Video Disk Recorder (VDR).

Description: Output to LCD modules that are supported by LCDproc

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

vdr -Plcdproc or -P"lcdproc -h <host> -p <port>" ... makes vdr connect to a LCDd.

Current channel info and menus are then displayed on the LCD too.

I had a 4x20 character display in mind but it should
work with 4x16 up to 4x40 and 2x40.
2x16+ displays should work too but are NOT fully supported.

LCDd can be used in an xterm or console too, so it
might be useful even without having the hardware.
( ./LCDd -d curses )

lcdtranstbl.h is used to map characters for output to LCDd.
Depending on the LCD hardware some characters may not displayed
correctly, you can fix that by selecting a in the setup menu: (Charmap)

0 ... nomap         no mapping, useful for the curses driver
1 ... hd44780
2 ... CFontz        Thanks to Stephan Schreiber <stephan@sschreiber.de>
3 ... SGX120        Thanks to Harald Milz <hm@seneca.muc.de>

lcdkeyconf.h is used to configure the plugin for a keypad.
you can use a different file instead with
LCDKEYCONF=/path/to/your/lcdkeyconf.h
during compile time.

Mattia Rossi <mattia@technologist.com> added support for the output pins
that some Matrix Orbital displays have (lcdm001 and glk driver).
So the card status among other things can be indecated by led.


Brief description of the setup menue:

FullCycle / TimeDateCycle
  during recording the same display toggles between time/date and card status
  FullCycle (seconds) is the time for a complete cycle while
  TimeDateCycle (seconds) is the duration where time/date is shown.

VolumeKeep
  ( 1/10 seconds ) how long the volume is shown on the display

Scrollwait
  ( 1/8 seconds )  duration before scrolling is started

Scrollspeed
  ( 1/8 seconds )  higher value means slower scrolling

Charmap
  see above.

AltShift
  when a keypad is used and a shiftkey is defined the type of shiftkey
  indication ( done by LCDproc's 'heartbeat' ) can be changed.

BackLight
  backlight on/off

OutputNumber
  implemented by Mattia Rossi <mattia@technologist.com>
  sets how many output pins should be used to indicate
  states like on/off, card status, ...

RecordingStatus
  configures whether the recording status is displayed "detailed"
  (for every dvb card) or only "simple".

ShowTime
  implemented by Sebastian Frei <sebastian@schnapsleichen.de>
  disable this if you have a small display and don't want to have
  the time displayed in the top line

  What's needed to run a LCD?

   Hardware:

     I used a single 4x20 LCD that works with the hd44780 8-bit driver on
     the printer port.
     ( availible at http://www.conrad.com/ product ID: 187275
       or see http://www.lcd-module.de/eng/doma/standard.htm )

                     GND  (1) (used the PC's power suppy (black cable))
                     +5V  (2) (used the PC's power suppy (red cable))
                     Vadj (3) (contrast, conneced to GND works fine for me)

                     --- optional for LCDs with background illumination ---

                     LED+ (15) (connected to +5V over a 100Ohm resisitor
                                to make it not too bright)
                     LED- (16) (connected to GND)

   Software:

     Last tested with lcdproc-0.4.1 ( http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/lcdproc/lcdproc-0.4.1.tar.gz )
     LCDd -d HD44780 "-p 0x3bc -c winamp"
     should run LCDd for the hardware described above conneceted to the
     printer port (in my case the port's base address is 0x3bc).
